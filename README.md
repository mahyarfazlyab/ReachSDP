# Reach-SDP
Code needed to reproduce the results in "[Reach-SDP: Reachability Analysis of Closed-Loop Systems with Neural Network Controllers via Semidefinite Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07876)" by Haimin Hu, Mahyar Fazlyab, Manfred Morari, and George J. Pappas, to appear at CDC 2020.

Code for the double integrator case study can be found [here](https://github.com/mahyarfazlyab/ReachSDP/tree/master/double_integrator_FRS)
